An automated way of resume named entity extraction (NER) makes the recruitment process easier and reduces the significant time in filtering and sorting all the
applicantsâ€™ resumes based on certain criteria and standards required from the company. The process of Resume NER classifies all the applicants based on their name,
qualifications, degree, skills, and more. The main objective of this study is to develop an Automated Resume NER for processing resumes. A new hybrid resume parsing system is proposed that combines a Rule-Based model, Machine Learning Model, and Transformer model. Based on the results, the hybrid entity extraction showed better performance as compared to the
single model. It has the highest detectability in classifying the value to respective entity labels. The hybrid model can extract the resume-named entities from the tested resume, such as name, email, phone number, skills, designation, company, and more. The proposed hybrid strategy enhances the results for identifying the resume-named entities with an achievement of precision 87.62% and recall 96.91%.
